*Building the Auth middleware*
- This is the middleware that will be used
to protect our routes. ( authenticate a user via their token)

it will need to be exported as a function so we can pass it
into our route as middleware. Don't forget to execute
next() so the next middleware can be ran.

This middleware will look at the req.header and pull the
'x-auth-token' from the header and attempt to verify
its validity using JWT.

if invalid, return 401 'UnAuthorized or Token invalid'

If all is ok, simply manipulate the body in the current
request by adding the user's ID (the decoded token)
